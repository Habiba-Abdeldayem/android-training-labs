# 🏀 Sports App – Adaptive Layout with Jetpack Compose

This project is a practice implementation based on the **Android Basics with Compose** pathway. The goal is to make the Sports app adaptive across different screen sizes using **WindowSizeClass** and a **canonical layout** approach.

---

## 📱 What is the Sports App?

The Sports App is a simple Jetpack Compose-based app that displays a list of sports and shows details about each one. The base app is already designed for compact (mobile) screens. This project enhances it to support **large and expanded screen sizes** (like tablets or foldables) using **side-by-side layouts**.
